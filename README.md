# GoNet
**Golang + Network**

This is a repository where I store and share my notes on computer networking. I cover the fundamental concepts and theories of computer networking and provide examples for their practical implementation.

Computer networking is a vital field that underpins the communication and data exchange between devices and systems. In this repository, I delve into the concepts and use the Go programming language to provide examples and exercises.

The repository is designed as a tool for me to document my learning and serve as a reference for future study.

All content, excluding the introduction, is written in Korean.
